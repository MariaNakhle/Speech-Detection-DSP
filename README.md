# Speech Detection in Real-Time  
Final Project for DSP Course  

## üìú Project Description

This project implements a **real-time speech detection system** based on signal processing techniques.  
The system processes a real-time audio signal, filters noise, calculates energy envelopes, and determines if speech is present. A visual LED indicator responds to speech detection.

Developed during the **DSP Processors Programming** course at the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

## üéØ Project Requirements

- Real-time signal acquisition at **1kHz** sample rate.
- Continuous signal sampling using a hardware timer (no gaps).
- Bandpass filter: **140Hz‚Äì420Hz** range using a **4th-order IIR elliptic filter** designed in MATLAB.
- Compute the **absolute value** of the filtered signal.
- Detect speech using a **dynamic threshold** based on signal energy.
- LED visual feedback:
  - LED ON = speech detected.
  - LED OFF = no speech detected.
- Display:
  - Original signal.
  - Filtered signal.
  - Frequency spectrum (FFT).
  - Task Execution Graph, CPU Load, and Task Load.

## üõ† Tools and Resources

- **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**: Code execution and debugging.
- **MATLAB Filter Designer**: Design of the 4th-order IIR elliptic bandpass filter.
- **Base Code**: Adapted from `GPIO_LedBlink` lab.
- **Input File**: Provided signal file `Speech_fs_1KHz.h`.

## üß© Software Architecture

- **HWI (Hardware Interrupt)**: Samples the signal via timer0.
- **SWI (Software Interrupt)**: Preprocesses the sampled data.
- **Task**: Full signal processing: filtering, envelope calculation, and speech detection.

RTOS elements used: `Semaphore`, `HWI`, `SWI`, `Task`.
